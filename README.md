# Example: Compose Paging With Search

This repository holds an example of using [andoridx.paging](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/paging) with a [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) app to provide live search results.

The interesting part is in found in [`ProductListViewModel`](app/src/main/java/uk/co/euantorano/example/compose_paging/ui/view_models/ProductListViewModel.kt) where the pager is configured.
